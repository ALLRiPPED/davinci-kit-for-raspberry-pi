msgid "You're now running the Processing Development Environment (or PDE). There's not much to it; the large area is the Text Editor, and there's a row of buttons across the top; this is the toolbar. Below the editor is the Message Area, and below that is the Console. The Message Area is used for one line messages, and the Console is used for more technical details."

msgid "If you run it and the message area turns red and reports some errors, then there is something wrong with the sketch. Make sure you copy the sample sketch exactly: numbers should be enclosed in parentheses, with commas between each number, and lines should end with semicolons."

msgid "Each pixel of the display window is a coordinate (x,y) that determines the position of a point in space. The origin (0,0) of the coordinates is in the upper left corner, the positive direction of the X-axis is horizontally to the right, and the positive direction of the Y-axis is vertically down."
