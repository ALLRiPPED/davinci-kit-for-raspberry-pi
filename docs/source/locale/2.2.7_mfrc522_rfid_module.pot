msgid "Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) refers to technologies that involve using wireless communication between an object (or tag) and an interrogating device (or reader) to automatically track and identify such objects. The tag transmission range is limited to several meters from the reader. A clear line of sight between the reader and tag is not necessarily required."

#: ../2.2.7_mfrc522_rfid_module.rst:36
msgid "Most tags contain at least one integrated circuit (IC) and an antenna. The microchip stores information and is responsible for managing the radio frequency (RF) communication with the reader. Passive tags do not have an independent energy source and depend on an external electromagnetic signal, provided by the reader, to power their operations. Active tags contain an independent energy source, such as a battery. Thus, they may have increased processing, transmission capabilities and range."

msgid "MFRC522 is a kind of integrated read and write card chip. It is commonly used in the radio at 13.56MHz. Launched by the NXP Company, it is a low-voltage, low-cost, and small-sized non-contact card chip, a best choice of intelligent instrument and portable handheld device."

msgid "The MF RC522 uses advanced modulation and demodulation concept which fully presented in all types of 13.56MHz passive contactless communication methods and protocols. In addition, it supports rapid CRYPTO1 encryption algorithm to verify MIFARE products. MFRC522 also supports MIFARE series of high-speed non-contact communication, with a two-way data transmission rate up to 424kbit/s. As a new member of the 13.56MHz highly integrated reader card series, MF RC522 is much similar to the existing MF RC500 and MF RC530 but there also exists great differences. It communicates with the host machine via the serial manner which needs less wiring. You can choose between SPI, I2C and serial UART mode (similar to RS232), which helps reduce the connection, save PCB board space (smaller size), and reduce cost."
