msgid "In this lesson, we will learn how to use a slide switch. Usually,the slide switch is soldered on PCB as a power switch, but here we need to insert it into the breadboard, thus it may not be tightened. And we use it on the breadboard to show its function."

msgid "A slide switch, just as its name implies, is to slide the switch bar to connect or break the circuit, and further switch circuits. The common-used types are SPDT, SPTT, DPDT, DPTT etc. The slide switch is commonly used in low-voltage circuit. It has the features of flexibility and stability, and applies in electric instruments and electric toys widely."

msgid "How it works: Set the middle pin as the fixed one. When you pull the slide to the left, the two pins on the left are connected; when you pull it to the right, the two pins on the right are connected. Thus, it works as a switch connecting or disconnecting circuits. See the figure below:"

msgid "Here we use **104 capacitor(10 x 10\\ 4\\ PF)**. Just like the ring of resistors, the numbers on the capacitors help to read the values once assembled onto the board. The first two digits represent the value and the last digit of the number means the multiplier. Thus 104 represents a power of 10 x 10 to 4 (in pF) equal to 100 nF."
