msgid "Just like photoresistor can sense light, thermistor is a temperature sensitive electronic device that can be used for realizing functions of temperature control, such as making a heat alarm."

msgid "A thermistor is a thermally sensitive resistor that exhibits a precise and predictable change in resistance proportional to small changes in temperature. How much its resistance will change is dependent upon its unique composition. Thermistors are the parts of a larger group of passive components. And unlike their active component counterparts, passive devices are incapable of providing power gain, or amplification to a circuit."
msgstr ""

#: ../2.2.2_thermistor.rst:28
msgid "Thermistor is a sensitive element, and it has two types: Negative Temperature Coefficient (NTC) and Positive Temperature Coefficient (PTC), also known as NTC and PTC. Its resistance varies significantly with temperature. The resistance of PTC thermistor increases with temperature ,while the condition of NTC is opposite to the former In this experiment we use NTC."
msgstr ""

#: ../2.2.2_thermistor.rst:38
msgid "The principle is that the resistance of the NTC thermistor changes with the temperature of the outer environment. It detects the real-time temperature of the environment. When the temperature gets higher, the resistance of the thermistor decreases. Then the voltage data is converted to digital quantities by the A/D adapter. The temperature in Celsius or Fahrenheit is output via programming."
