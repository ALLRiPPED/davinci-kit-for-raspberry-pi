msgid "Photoresistor is a commonly used component of ambient light intensity in life. It helps the controller to recognize day and night and realize light control functions such as night lamp. This project is very similar to potentiometer, and you might think it changing the voltage to sensing light."

msgid "A photoresistor or photocell is a light-controlled variable resistor. The resistance of a photoresistor decreases with increasing incident light intensity; in other words, it exhibits photo conductivity. A photoresistor can be applied in light-sensitive detector circuits, and light- and darkness-activated switching circuits."

msgid "Read the analog value of CH0 of ADC0834. By default, the function getResult() is used to read the value of CH0, so if you want to read other channels, please input 1, 2, or 3 into () of the function getResult(). Next, what you need is to print the value via the print function. Because the changing element is the duty cycle of LedPin, the computational formula, analogVal*100/255 is needed to convert analogVal into percentage. Finally, ChangeDutyCycle() is called to write the percentage into LedPin."
