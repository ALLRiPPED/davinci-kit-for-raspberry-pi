msgid "In this project, we will make a device by using the human body infrared pyroelectric sensors. When someone gets closer to the LED, the LED will turn on automatically. If not, the light will turn off. This infrared motion sensor is a kind of sensor that can detect the infrared emitted by human and animals."

msgid "The PIR sensor detects infrared heat radiation that can be used to detect the presence of organisms that emit infrared heat radiation."

#: ../2.2.4_pir.rst:25
msgid "The PIR sensor is split into two slots that are connected to a differential amplifier. Whenever a stationary object is in front of the sensor, the two slots receive the same amount of radiation and the output is zero. Whenever a moving object is in front of the sensor, one of the slots receives more radiation than the other , which makes the output fluctuate high or low. This change in output voltage is a result of detection of motion."

msgid "After the sensing module is wired, there is a one-minute initialization. During the initialization, module will output for 0~3 times at intervals. Then the module will be in the standby mode. Please keep the interference of light source and other sources away from the surface of the module so as to avoid the misoperation caused by the interfering signal. Even you'd better use the module without too much wind, because the wind can also interfere with the sensor."

msgid "Turning the knob of the distance adjustment potentiometer clockwise, the range of sensing distance increases, and the maximum sensing distance range is about 0-7 meters. If turn it anticlockwise, the range of sensing distance is reduced, and the minimum sensing distance range is about 0-3 meters."

There are two potentiometers on the PIR module: one is to adjust sensitivity and the other is to adjust the detection distance. In order to make the PIR module work better, you need to try to adjust these two potentiometers."
