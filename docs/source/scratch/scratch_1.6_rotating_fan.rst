Load the Code and See What Happens
---------------------------------------

Load the code file (``1.6_rotating_fan.sb3``) to Scratch 3.

Click on the green flag on the stage to start the project. Click on the Star sprite, it and the motor will rotate clockwise. You can change the direction of rotation by clicking on 2 Arrow sprites. When you click on the Star sprite again, it and the motor will stop rotating.

Tips on Sprite
----------------
Delete the default sprite, then select the **Star** sprite and the **Arrow1** sprite, and copy Arrow1 once.

In the **Costumes** option, change the Arrow2 sprite to a different direction costume.

In this code, you will see 2 pink blocks, turn left and turn right, which are our custom blocks.

**How to Make a Block?**

Let's learn how to make a block (function). The block (function) can be used to simplify your program, especially if you perform the same operation multiple times. Putting these operations into a newly declared block can be very convenient for you.

First find **My Blocks** in the block palette, then select **Make a Block**.

Enter the name of the new block.

After writing the function of the new block in the coding area, save it and then you can find the block in the blocks palette.

**turn left**

This is the code content of the turn left block to make the motor rotate counterclockwise.
